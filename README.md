<h1># Funky Shapes Interactive Website ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¥</h1>

This is a fun, interactive website I created for my sister while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! The website features funky shapes that move around the screen, and when you click on them, a random positive message appears! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒŸ

I made this project to practice my front-end skills while creating something playful and encouraging. Itâ€™s a small but fun way to brighten someoneâ€™s day! ðŸ˜Š

## How to Use ðŸ“²

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enjoy clicking on the shapes to receive some positive vibes! ðŸ’«
